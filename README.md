# Intro to Language Modeling with RNNs
This repo contains three notebooks to accompany the workshop "Introduction to language modeling with RNNs", as well as certain resources used in them.
I am particularly grateful to the folks at [OpenStreetMap](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_pan_roads) and [Ibrahim Naji](https://huggingface.co/datasets/carblacac/twitter-sentiment-analysis) for making their datasets freely available to use.
